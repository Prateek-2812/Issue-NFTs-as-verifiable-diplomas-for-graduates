# NFT Diplomas: Issue NFTs as Verifiable Diplomas for Graduates

## Vision

The **NFT Diplomas** platform aims to revolutionize the way educational institutions issue and verify diplomas by leveraging blockchain technology. By issuing **Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)** as diplomas, we create a secure, transparent, and tamper-proof method of certifying academic achievements. This eliminates the risk of forged diplomas and allows employers, institutions, and individuals to verify academic credentials instantly.

## Features

- **NFT-based Diploma Issuance**: Educational institutions can mint verifiable diplomas as NFTs on the blockchain, ensuring authenticity and permanence.
- **Decentralized Verification**: Diplomas can be verified by anyone on the blockchain, providing a trustless system where no central authority is required.
- **Immutable Records**: Once issued, diplomas cannot be altered or tampered with, providing confidence to both the issuer and recipient.
- **Ownership & Transfer**: Each diploma is assigned to a student’s blockchain address, and only the diploma holder can prove ownership or transfer the NFT.
- **Simple User Interface**: Issue and view diplomas via an easy-to-use UI, designed for both administrators and students.

## Contract Information

1. **`issue_nft_diploma(issuer: &signer, student: address, title: string)`**  
   This function allows the issuer (e.g., an academic institution) to create and assign an NFT diploma to a student’s blockchain address. Each diploma includes a title, the issuer’s address, and the student’s address.

   This function allows anyone to view the diploma details for a given student's address. It retrieves the diploma data, including the title and the issuer's address.

### Technologies Used:
